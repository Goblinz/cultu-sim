Cultu Sim ReadME
Work In progress

The Program currently spawns an actor (the blue circle) at 6,6 and will patrol to 5,5 to 0,5 to 5,0 in an endless loop
To progress the program click the next turn and the actor will move
clicking on a tile will display what kind of tile in the console

If you want you can add more actors in the Main method (in the Main class),  just give them at least 2 points and they won't move if there is another actor in the way
